# Prepare for Release:
# 1) Check that there are no uncommitted changes in the sources
# 2) Check that there are no SNAPSHOT dependencies
# 3) Change the version in the POMs from x-SNAPSHOT to a new version (you will be prompted for the versions to use)
# 4) Transform the SCM information in the POM to include the final destination of the tag
# 5) Run the project tests against the modified POMs to confirm everything is in working order
# 6) Commit the modified POMs
# 7) Tag the code in the SCM with a version name (this will be prompted for)
# 8) Modify the version in the POMs to a new value y-SNAPSHOT (these values will also be prompted for)
# 9) Commit the modified POMs
# Perform Release:
# 1) Checkout from the SCM URL (tag prompted in step 7)
# 2) Run the predefined Maven goals to release the project:
#    -This will stage QTaste (from tag version prompted in step 7) into sonatype, being prepared to be released.
